# 🧙‍♂️ Wizardly X-Ray Vertebra Distancing Spell (README)

## Welcome, Brave Mage of the Digital Realm! 🌀

Greetings, fellow conjurer of software sorcery! You have stumbled upon the *Arcane Repository of Vertebral Spacing Magic* — a mystical program created by an ancient coven of software wizards (us, mere mortals with keyboards) to assist in the measurement of the distance between vertebrae on X-ray images.

Come! Let us embark on a journey to understand the great enchantments and spells you must wield to label and measure the unseen wonders of the human spine!

## 📜 The Purpose of This Arcane Spell

The magic within this repository has one solemn purpose: to label the distances between the vertebrae of an X-ray image. Whether you are a healer, a mage of data, or simply a curious soul, this spell allows you to measure spinal separations without requiring years of training in physical divination.

Now, with a flourish of your coding wand, behold the wonder of accurate, repeatable measurements! ✨

## 🛠️ Ritual of Installation

Before casting any spells, you must prepare your enchanting environment. Follow these steps to set up your potion-brewing cauldron (also known as your computer):

1. Summon **Python** (Version 3.7 or beyond) — an essential language of incantation.
2. Install the sacred packages by whispering this spell to your command line:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. `May your spells never run out of mana (dependencies)!`

## 📸 Casting the Spell

To perform the measurement enchantment, speak the following incantation into your terminal:

```sh
python distance_GUIV1.py
```

When you run this, a **GUI of Sorcery** shall appear, granting you the power to upload an X-ray and wield your wand (mouse) to label the vertebrae and summon the distance in between!

### ✨ Step-by-Step Guide for the Magic Ritual

1. **Summon the Interface**: Run the script to bring forth the magic user interface (MUI).
2. **Upload Your Target**: Offer the X-ray to the program (browse and upload the image).
3. **Point the Wand**: Click on each vertebra, marking their locations.
4. **Summon the Distance**: Behold! The distances will be calculated with precision as if by the touch of Merlin himself!

## 🧙‍♀️ Advanced Spells & Features

- **Manual Calibration Charm**: Specify scale or adjust units to match your needs, because every wizard has their own measurements.
- **Mystic Annotations**: Label vertebrae with mystical runes (or just, you know, numbers) to keep track of your markings.
- **Multiple Distance Calculations**: Cast the spell as many times as needed, comparing different distances to your heart's content.

## 🧪 Ingredients (Dependencies)

- **Tkinter**: For conjuring the mystical Graphical User Interface
- **Pillow**: To handle and visualize the sacred images (X-rays)
- **NumPy**: For those numerical spells, when basic magic just won't do

(Other common Pythonic magic ingredients may also be required — check `requirements.txt` for full details.)

## ⚠️ Warnings from the Wizard Council

- **This spell is for aiding measurement purposes only**. It is not a replacement for trained clerics or professional healers in medical diagnosis. It is merely a magical abacus for distances!
- The spell might malfunction when faced with X-rays of dragons, unicorns, or any other fantastical beings (because we haven't tested it on them yet).
